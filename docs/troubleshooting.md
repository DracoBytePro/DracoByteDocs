## 🛑 Server Won’t Start

**Possible Causes**
- Missing or invalid `server.jar`
- Not enough allocated memory (RAM)
- Outdated or incompatible mods/plugins
- Corrupted world files

**Fix**
1. Check the **Console** for any red error lines.
2. If using a custom jar, make sure the filename is exactly `server.jar`.
3. Stop the server → go to **Settings → Reinstall Server** (if needed).
4. If it still fails, open a ticket — include your console log.

- Ensure you’re connecting to the correct version (e.g., 1.21, 1.20.6).
- Restart the server after uploading a new jar or plugin pack.

## 🔄 File Upload Errors

- Use the **File Manager** or **SFTP** (see connection info in the panel).
